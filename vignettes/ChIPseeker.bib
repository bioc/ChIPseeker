	abstract = {Androgen receptor ({AR)} is overexpressed in the majority of castration-resistant prostate cancers ({CRPCs).} Our goal was to study the effect of {AR} overexpression on the chromatin binding of the receptor and to identify {AR} target genes that may be important in the emergence of {CRPC.} We have established two sublines of {LNCaP} prostate cancer ({PC)} cell line, one overexpressing {AR} 2-3-fold and the other 4-5-fold compared with the control cells. We used chromatin immunoprecipitation ({ChIP)} and deep-sequencing (seq) to identify {AR-binding} sites ({ARBSs).} We found that the number of {ARBSs} and the {AR-binding} strength were positively associated with the level of {AR} when cells were stimulated with low concentrations of androgens. In cells overexpressing {AR}, the chromatin binding of the receptor took place in 100-fold lower concentration of the ligand than in control cells. We confirmed the association of {AR} level and chromatin binding in two {PC} xenografts, one containing {AR} gene amplification with high {AR} expression, and the other with low expression. By combining the {ChIP-seq} and expression profiling, we identified {AR} target genes that are upregulated in {PC.} Of them, the expression of {ZWINT}, {SKP2} (S-phase kinase-associated protein 2 (p45)) and {FEN1} (flap structure-specific endonuclease 1) was demonstrated to be increased in {CRPC}, while the expression of {SNAI2} was decreased in both {PC} and {CRPC.} {FEN1} protein expression was also associated with poor prognosis in prostatectomy-treated patients. Finally, the knock-down of {FEN1} with small interfering {RNA} inhibited the growth of {LNCaP} cells. Our data demonstrate that the overexpression of {AR} sensitizes the receptor binding to chromatin, thus, explaining how {AR} signaling pathway is reactivated in {CRPC} cells.},

	title = {Genome-wide co-localization of Polycomb orthologs and their effects on gene expression in human fibroblasts},
	volume = {15},
	issn = {1465-6914},
	doi = {10.1186/gb-2014-15-2-r23},
	abstract = {{BACKGROUND:} Polycomb group proteins form multicomponent complexes that are important for establishing lineage-specific patterns of gene expression. Mammalian cells encode multiple permutations of the prototypic Polycomb repressive complex 1 ({PRC1)} with little evidence for functional specialization. An aim of this study is to determine whether the multiple orthologs that are co-expressed in human fibroblasts act on different target genes and whether their genomic location changes during cellular senescence.
{RESULTS:} Deep sequencing of chromatin immunoprecipitated with antibodies against {CBX6}, {CBX7}, {CBX8}, {RING1} and {RING2} reveals that the orthologs co-localize at multiple sites. {PCR-based} validation at representative loci suggests that a further six {PRC1} proteins have similar binding patterns. Importantly, sequential chromatin immunoprecipitation with antibodies against different orthologs implies that multiple variants of {PRC1} associate with the same {DNA.} At many loci, the binding profiles have a distinctive architecture that is preserved in two different types of fibroblast. Conversely, there are several hundred loci at which {PRC1} binding is cell type-specific and, contrary to expectations, the presence of {PRC1} does not necessarily equate with transcriptional silencing. Interestingly, the {PRC1} binding profiles are preserved in senescent cells despite changes in gene expression.
{CONCLUSIONS:} The multiple permutations of {PRC1} in human fibroblasts congregate at common rather than specific sites in the genome and with overlapping but distinctive binding profiles in different fibroblasts. The data imply that the effects of {PRC1} complexes on gene expression are more subtle than simply repressing the loci at which they bind.},
