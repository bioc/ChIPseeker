Title: ChIPseeker for ChIP peak Annotation, Visualization and Comparison
Version: 1.0.1
Author: Guangchuang Yu
Maintainer: Guangchuang Yu <guangchuangyu@gmail.com>
Description: This package implements functions to retrieve the nearest
        genes around the peak, annotate genomic region of the peak.
        Visualization functions are implemented to summarize genomic
        annotation, distance to TSS, and overlap of peaks or genes.
